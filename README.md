# Datasets


# File structure
The directories should be in the following format:
src
    -sample_based
data
    -aging <br />
    -binary <br />
    -breast_cancer <br />

# Running the code
There are three jupyter notebooks that should be used to run the code. 
The first two are in the src directory and are named.
AFVA.ipynb and Uncertainty_v2.ipynb

The third is in the directory src/sample_based and is named: run_simpulations.ipynb
